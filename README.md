# Super Galactic Age Calculator - Skye Nguyen

#### Epicodus Independent Project - Advanced JavaScript Week 1 - 10/12/2018.

## Description

A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days.

This is an application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years.

## Test Driven Development Specs

* Take in the user's DOB and find the user's age in Earth years.
* The program will return the user's age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
* The program will return the user's age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
* The program will return the user's age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
* The program will return the user's age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
* The program will calculate the user’s life expectancy using average life expectancy for their demographic.
* The program will determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet.
* If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, the program will return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
